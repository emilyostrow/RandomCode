# Replacing uninformative sites from a phlip
ReplaceUninformativeSites.R - This code replaces all phylogenetically uninformative sites with a default N or whatever you want (e.g. - or ?). This is potentially useful with checking the output of UCE alignments with toepads. Toepad alignments seem to have extra erroneous SNPs that cause long branches. The code takes a phylip as an input and outputs a phylip as a text file.
